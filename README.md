## Data Engineering on Reddit Posts: A Complete Pipeline

This project sets up a high-performance ETL pipeline for Reddit data. The pipeline uses a modernÂ technology stack, with Apache Airflow directing the flow and Celery handling distributed jobs. Data is extracted from the API, converted using AWS Glue, and actively queried with Athena before being placed into the Amazon Redshift data warehouse for in-depth analysis.
